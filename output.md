# AI Project Summary

## Problem Statement
Develop a model to predict the price of houses using the given data

## Data Assessment Agent

**Task Summary:** Assess the data and suggest preprocessing steps. Include:
  ...

**Key Recommendations:**
**Data Assessment Report**
**Data Collection and Exploration Insights**
**Data Quality Assessment**
1. **Missing Values**: The `Price` column contains NaN values, which need to be handled.
2. **Object Data Types**: The `Suburb`, `Address`, `Type`, `Method`, `SellerG`, `CouncilArea`, and `Regionname` columns are of object data type, which may require additional preprocessing steps.
3. **Date Column**: The `Date` column is of object data type, which may need to be converted to a datetime format for further analysis.
**Necessary Preprocessing Steps**
1. **Handle Missing Values**: Impute the missing values in the `Price` column using a suitable imputation method, such as mean or median imputation.
2. **Encode Object Data Types**: Convert the object data types to numerical or categorical data types using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
3. **Convert Date Column**: Convert the `Date` column to a datetime format using the `pd.to_datetime()` function.
**Feature Engineering Suggestions**
1. **Extract Date Features**: Extract relevant date features, such as year, month, and day, from the `Date` column.
2. **Create New Features**: Create new features, such as the distance to the city center or the proximity to public transportation, using the `Distance` and `Postcode` columns.
3. **Aggregate Features**: Aggregate features, such as the average `Price` or `Landsize` per `Suburb`, to capture neighborhood-level patterns.

## AI Technique Recommendation Agent

**Task Summary:** Recommend suitable AI techniques. Include:
     ...

**Key Recommendations:**
**Recommended Techniques:**
1. **Linear Regression**: A simple and interpretable model that can capture the linear relationships between the features and the target variable (Price).
2. **Decision Trees**: A tree-based model that can handle both numerical and categorical features, and can capture non-linear relationships.
3. **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model.
4. **Gradient Boosting**: Another ensemble method that combines multiple weak models to create a strong predictor.
5. **Neural Networks**: A deep learning approach that can capture complex non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable.
6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple and interpretable model that can capture local patterns in the data.
7. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A model that can capture non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable, and can handle high-dimensional data.
**Rationale:**
* Linear Regression is a simple and interpretable model that can capture the linear relationships between the features and the target variable.
* Decision Trees and Random Forest can handle both numerical and categorical features, and can capture non-linear relationships.
* Gradient Boosting and Neural Networks can capture complex non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable.

**Technique Selection Criteria:**
1. **Data Complexity**: If the data is complex and has non-linear relationships, techniques like Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and SVM may be more suitable.
2. **Feature Importance**: If feature importance is crucial, techniques like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest may be more suitable.
3. **Interpretability**: If interpretability is crucial, techniques like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and KNN may be more suitable.

  ...

**Key Recommendations:**
**Importance of Cross-Validation**
**Implementing k-Fold Cross-Validation**
**Guidelines for Interpreting Cross-Validation Results**
* A high cross-validation score indicates that the model is generalizing well to new, unseen data.
* A low cross-validation score indicates that the model may be overfitting or underfitting the training data.
* Compare the cross-validation scores across different models to determine which model is performing best.
* Use the cross-validation results to tune hyperparameters and improve the model's performance.

**Code Snippets:**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Perform k-fold cross-validation for each model
cv_results = {}
for name, model in models.items():
